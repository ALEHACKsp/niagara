# Niagara

This is a Vulkan renderer that is written on stream from scratch - without using any third party code that is Vulkan specific. We are using non-Vulkan-specific third party libraries however.

The goal is to experiment with a few modern Vulkan rendering techniques, such as GPU culling & scene submission, cone culling, automatic occlusion culling, task/mesh shading, and whatever else it is that we will want to experiment with.
The code will be written exclusively on stream.

# Requirements

The renderer is written using Visual Studio and targets Windows desktops with modern Vulkan drivers. You will need Visual Studio 2017 and Vulkan SDK to follow along
